# 🚀 Day 01 – Backend Basics (Server Response & Deployment)

## 📌 What I Learned Today
On Day 01, I learned the fundamentals of backend development using **Node.js and Express**.  
The main focus was understanding how a **server responds to a user request** and how to **deploy the server to the cloud using Render**.

## 1️⃣ Program to Send Server Response to User

- The server sends a response back to the user

This is the basic **client–server communication model**.
